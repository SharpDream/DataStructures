## Introduction

Data structures are a crucial part of computer science. They allow us to store and organize data efficiently. This repository provides implementations of various data structures along with explanations and usage examples.

## Data Structures

### Array

An array is a collection of elements identified by index or key. Arrays are one of the simplest and most widely used data structures.

### Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes. Each node contains a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.

### Stack

A stack is a collection of elements that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are added and removed from the top of the stack.

### Queue

A queue is a collection of elements that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at the back and removed from the front.

### Hash Table

A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values for highly efficient lookup. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots.

### Tree

A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. The top node is called the root, and each node has zero or more child nodes.

### Graph

A graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect pairs of nodes. Graphs can be used to represent networks, such as social networks or communication networks.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have implemented a data structure that is not in this repository, feel free to open a pull request. Please ensure your code is well-documented and includes tests.

### How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
